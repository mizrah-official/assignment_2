                Neil Patel likes to say that he was born with entrepreneurship in his blood. Growing up, he was surrounded by small business owners—mostly his uncles, mom, and dad.Starting at age 15, Patel began selling CDs and auto parts to other students at school. His first “real” company was called AdviceMonkey, an Internet job board that ultimately failed, but taught him all about marketing an Internet business.
